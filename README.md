## INTRODUCTION

The WeatherAppTest project is a project that implements the coding task specified in the "specification.pdf" file. The project is about reading weather forecast data initially from a static json file and then later from a 3rd party api and then displaying the data on a web page.

## INSTALLATION

The app has been implemented in two ways with the one requiring only a web browser to run and the latter requiring java 8 and maven to be installed:

- To run the first example, which uses the static data from the specification, all that one has to do is download the zip file in the link [Zip-File](https://github.com/Zuks86/WeatherAppTest/blob/master/src/main/resources/static/no-server/static-weather-forecast.zip) and then unzip it and double click on the "index.html" file to run in on your browser of choice.
