## INTRODUCTION

The WeatherAppTest project is a project that implements the coding task specified in the "specification.pdf" file. The project is about reading weather forecast data initially from a static json file and then later from a 3rd party api and then displaying the data on a web page.

## INSTALLATION

The app has been implemented in two ways with the one requiring only a web browser to run and the latter requiring java 8 and maven to be installed:

1) To run the first option, which uses the static data from the specification, all that one has to do is download the zip file in the link [Zip-File](https://github.com/Zuks86/WeatherAppTest/blob/master/src/main/resources/static/no-server/static-weather-forecast.zip) and then unzip it and double click on the "index.html" file to run in on your browser of choice.

2) To run the second option, which contains both the static and the dynamic version, you need to have java-8 and maven installed in your device. You can find the installation instructions to these respectively at [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
